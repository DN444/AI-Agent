# AI-Agent
The json for the AI agent I made using n8n for K.A.M.A.L.A's mini-hackathon



1)Scheduler generates timestamp and is set
to auto-activate the workflow at every 6 hours interval.



2)Userâ€™s interests are predefined.



3)Based on this the user agent searches for
the latest news relating to the topics the user wants



4)Searches are made using SerpAPI



5)The model sends the requested info in 2
forms



6)One: as a message on Discord via a
webhook



7)Two: it converts the message into
markdown and forwards it to your Gmail.
